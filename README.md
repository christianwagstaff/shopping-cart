# E-Commerce React Site

E-Commerce site where users can click through items, add them to a cart, edit the amount, and remove items from the cart. In the admin section, users are able to create, edit and delete the plants for sell, as well as create, edit and delete the plant categories. This is handled through an API that I created and hosted through Heroku with a connection to a MongoDB database. The code for this is available to see [here](https://github.com/christianwagstaff/planty-db).

The site was creating using React, React-Router (to handle the routing), and React-Query (to handle the caching). This was my first time using React-Query, so I spent many hours looking though its docs to discover how to implement its caching properly.
